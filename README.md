## Approach

The project follows a fundamental outline:

1. **Data Merging**: Merge provided CSV data files to create a comprehensive DataFrame.
2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Explore and clean the data, addressing issues such as missing values and inconsistencies.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and categorize industries into groups such as Retail, Poultry, Agriculture, and Manufacturing.
4. **Machine Learning**: Perform machine learning tasks, including training a model to predict relevant workforce features.
5. **Geo-Visualization**: Develop a dashboard app using Streamlit and Plotly to visually represent the distribution of workers across various industries with respect to different geographical regions.
